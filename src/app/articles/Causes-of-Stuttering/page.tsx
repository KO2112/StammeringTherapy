          The differences in researchers' perspectives on stuttering are reflected not only in the variety of definitions but also in their views on the causes of the disorder. Sometimes, researchers' opinions on the causes of stuttering have been partially or fully demonstrated in their definitions of the condition (Silverman, 2004).

        <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          Thus, studies conducted on the causes of stuttering have provided guidance for defining and solving this problem. Despite numerous explanations and solutions proposed over many years of research, stuttering has not been attributed to a single cause (Manning, 2001).

      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Stuttering has been present throughout human history. In fact, there are discussions regarding whether Moses was a stutterer. The earliest indicators of stuttering were presented by the Egyptians, who used a series of hieroglyphs representing the term for “halting speech” (Faulkner, 1962). The act of stuttering was noted in a copy of a story from Egypt's Middle Kingdom, considered one of the earliest pieces of evidence for a communication disorder (Manning, 2010).

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-indigo-700">Theories of Stuttering Causes</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        One of the oldest views regarding the causes of stuttering, which has been debated for about 5,000 years, is that it is a form of punishment for a mistake or fault of the parent or child. This perspective has been reflected in ancient mythological stories and remains valid in some cultures and socioeconomic groups today (Silverman, 2004).

      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In the fourth century BC, it was believed that stuttering might be related to the structure and function of language. It is noted that the Greek politician Demosthenes attempted to overcome his stuttering by placing pebbles under his tongue. This idea was the most widely accepted view between Aristotle and the Renaissance.

        Over time, other anatomical structures of the body have also been associated with stuttering. Consequently, some surgical methods have frequently been recommended for addressing the issue (Bloodstein, 1995; Manning, 2001).

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-indigo-700">Current Theoretical Framework</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Today, theories about stuttering can primarily be examined in four main groups:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8 space-y-3 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        <li><strong>Psychological Theories:</strong> View stuttering as a symptom of psychological or emotional conflict.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Theories:</strong> Suggest that stuttering begins when the speaker finds speaking difficult and learns to anticipate and struggle with it.</li>
        <li><strong>Physiological Theories:</strong> Describe the disruption of fluent speech as a reaction to various stressful situations.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Component Theories:</strong> Combine factors leading to the onset and development of stuttering (Manning, 2010).</li>
